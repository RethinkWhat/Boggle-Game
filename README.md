# Boggle (Word Factory)

## Description
This project involves creating a server program that allows connections from client programs, enabling players to login using their credentials. The server verifies credentials by checking a database and ensures single-session access. Once authenticated, players can initiate the game and starts if another player joins within the given waiting time.

Each round involves forming words from 20 random letters within a time limit. Players earn points for unique valid words submitted, with the highest scorer winning each round. The first player to win three rounds claims victory.
